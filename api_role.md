# ROLE API

This page describes the K2HR3 ROLE API. The purpose of the ROLE API is to create and update and get and delete a K2HR3 ROLE. See the [Basic Usage](usage_base.html) about the K2HR3 ROLE in the K2HR3.

* A scoped user token exists in request parameters.
* A role token exists in request parameters.

### Endpoint(URL)
#### A Scoped User Token
http(s)://_API SERVER:PORT_/v1/role/token/_role path or yrn full role path_

### URL Arguments(only for Scoped User Token)
- expire = _0 or expiration seconds(decimal) _  
You can specify the expiration date of the RoleToken to be issued in seconds.  
If not specified, the default value(value set in config or 24H will expire) will be used.  
If 0 is specified, a Token has no expiration(exactly 10 years as default, and configurable with config).

```
In addition, the string is encrypted, base64 encoded and encodeURI（+'/',':','?'） encoded. The string is used as a part of userdata API（/v1/userdata） URI Path string.

### Note

When issuing with Scoped User Token, it is possible to specify the expiration date. If not specified, the default value is used. (The default value can be specified in config)  
When Role Token is specified, it is issued with the same expiration date as that set for the specified RoleToken.
If Token is not specified, the default value is always used.
#### Reissuing RoleToken
When Role Token is specified, the newly issued RoleToken is the reissued RoleToken, and the specified RoleToken cannot be used (invalid) after the reissue.

## DELETE(Hostname/IP address deletion - Role not specified)
This API specifies **CUK** (Custom Unique Key) that is specified when the IP address is automatically registered.  
And remove the IP address below the ROLE key registered with the same **CUK**.  

This API is used to delete an automatically registered IP address (or Hostname) from OpenStack and kubernetes.  
K2HR3 supports automatic registration of IP addresses by USER DATA SCRIPT as OpenStack support.  
For kubernetes pod registration, the K2HR3 system offers a dedicated Sidecar.  
These automatic registrations are systems in which each IP address is registered by specifying CUK.  
This API is provided to allow you to delete an IP address by specifying CUK.  

This API is not intended to be used from K2HR3 Web Application or directly using the API.  
This API is called from Neutron Notification Listner which is hooking to RabbitMQ of OpenStack and from deletion logic of Pods by kubernetes.  

For calling this API from OpenStack Neutron Notification Listner is allowed only from the IP address registered in Tenant/Role for which the following settings have been configured as the K2HR3 Web Application config.  
_You can set in default.json or local.json_
```
{
  'k2hr3admin': {
     'tenant':      'admintenant',
     'delhostrole': 'delhostrole'
  }
}
```

### Endpoint(URL)
http(s)://_API SERVER:PORT_/v1/role?_urlarg_

### Header
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

### URL Arguments
- cuk = _custom unique key_  
When registering an OpenStack VirtualMachine, specify its **Instance ID**.  
When registering from a pod of kubernetes, specify the CUK string calculated for registration (automatically calculated by Sidecar provided by the K2HR3 system).  
The IP address associated with this value will be deleted.
- host  
This parameter specifies the IP address to be deleted.  
Of the IP addresses associated with **CUK**, only the IP address specified by this parameter is subject to deletion.  
When specifying multiple IP addresses, specify them as a string array in the JSON object.  
For a single IP address, specify a character string.  
If this parameter is not specified and only **CUK** is specified, all IP addresses linked to ** CUK ** will be deleted.  
_When registering with OpenStack or kubernets, it is assumed that there is only one IP address linked to CUK, and it is not usually necessary to specify the host parameter._
